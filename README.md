if you have used more fuel then you have refueled. <br />
Its primary used for when you are using someone elses car and want to keep track globally.

### Techinacal overview
The "benzine-verbruik" repository has a full **MEAN** stack application seperated into 2 folders. <br />
The folders are categorized as frontend (web) and backend (api). <br />
Both have there own gitignore and env file. The reason is to keep it structured, clean and uncluttered. <br />
This has to be done with future changes in mind like implement nestjs in the current api. <br />
The api uses rest for the same reason as stated above.
